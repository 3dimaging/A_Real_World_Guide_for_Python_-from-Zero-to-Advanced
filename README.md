# A_Real_World_Guide_for_Python_from_0_to_Advanced

The real world of python learner: you may have only 30 min per day to learn Python programming. It is quite often that sometimes you may not have no time at all. When you have time to go back where you left, you will find you forget everything. Because of the working load, family duties and other unexpected staff to deal with, you can be still at the entry level after a year of learning and have to start over again.

This tutorial is to help you to break the strange cycle and really improve your programming skill through the journely of mastering Python.

First, I want to mention something important, but you may not pay attention to before reading this tutorial.

Active vs. Passive learning

The framework of Knowledge is more important than the Knowledge itself. 


## step 0: basic setup

### create an account on https://stackoverflow.com

    This is a website you will visit everyday. This is an important website to ask any question. The answers are usually already there.
    The only thing you need to do is Google your question.
    
### create an OneNote or Evernote account.

    Then have their clippers installed to your web browser. If you find your anwser on web, save it by the clippers
    
### have a notebook (paper or electronic) to write down what you know and you need to know.

    At the begining, you may just write down some keywords in your brain. later on, you will write down the knowledge tree to show the
    connections of the key words to each other. 
    

## step 1: get to know Python

"Everything is an Object." --- Don't be fooled. That just means using "." in your code. Forget object now. 

### material to read


### the best way to learn python

First, find a piece of code online, then type in all the lines on your computer, and check the results.

### know well the function "print()"

## step 2: if...else...

### set up Python environment

### if...else...

### for loop

### the common mistakes

## step 3: the three founding pillars of Python

### Numpy

## step 4: getting serious about programming

### Find a handy IDE

### Good habits for coding

### Get familiar with commond modules

#### sys

#### re

## step 5: Building block accumulation

Programming is like building Legos. You have lots of building units and use them to make a castle, car or anything you think is cool. But the building units are the same. Programming follows the same logic. So what's the building unit for Python programming? 

## step 6: Objecte Oriented Programming

I found this part is the hardest one. People get scared away by the strange names like, self, __init__, etc.


### basic rules

### magic functions

## step 7: specialized areas

### Data Science

### Computer Vision

### Machine Learning

## step 8: ramp up a package

### Documentation Tools

### Logging

### Testing
