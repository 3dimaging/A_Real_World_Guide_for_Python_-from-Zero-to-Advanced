# A_Real_World_Guide_for_Python_from_0_to_Advanced

The real world of python learner: you may have only 30 min per day to learn Python programming. It is quite often that sometimes you may not have no time at all. When you have time to go back where you left, you will find you forget everything. Because of the working load, family duties and other unexpected staff to deal with, you can be at the entry level after a year learning and have to start over again.

This tutorial is to help you to break the strange cycle and really improve your programming skill through the journely of mastering Python.

First, I want to mention something important, but you may not pay attention to.

Active vs. Passive learning

  

## step 1: get to know Python

### material to read

### the best way to learn python

## step 5: Building block accumulation

Programming is like building Legos. You have lots of building units and use them to make a castle, car or anything you think is cool. But the building units are the same. Programming follows the same logic. So what's the building unit for Python programming? 

## step 6: Objecte Oriented Programming

I found this part is the hardest one. People get scared away by the strange names like, self, __init__, etc.


### basic rules

### magic functions

## step 7: specialized areas

### Data Science

### Computer Vision

### Machine Learning

## step 8: ramp up a package

### Documentation Tools
